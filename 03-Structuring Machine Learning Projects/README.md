## ML Strategy (1)

 **1. Learning Objectives**
> - Explain why Machine Learning strategy is important
> - Apply satisficing and optimizing metrics to set up your goal for ML projects
> - Choose a correct train/dev/test split of your dataset
> - Define human-level performance
> - Use human-level performance to define key priorities in ML projects
> - Take the correct ML Strategic decision based on observations of performances and dataset
 2. Introduction to ML Strategy
 3. Setting up your goal
 4. Comparing to human level performance
## ML Strategy (2)
**1. Learning Objectives**  
> - Describe multi-task learning and transfer learning
> -   Recognize bias, variance and data-mismatch by looking at the performances of your algorithm on train/dev/test sets
